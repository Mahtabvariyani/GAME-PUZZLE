## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that creates the structure of the game interface.

2. Use the play button in the navigation to control the background audio.
3. Arrange the puzzle pieces by dragging and dropping them onto the game board.
4. Try to solve the puzzle by swapping pieces to the correct positions.
5. The game will keep track of your moves using the turn counter.
